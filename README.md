# cerebro
Cerebro was a brain computer interface system which used the concept of context switching to control devices and processes depending on the proximity of the user with the device to be controlled. 
This implementation used two devices/ processes for the purpose of demonstration: a door which opened and closed, and a YouTube video that paused and played. The trigger was a head movement detected through an OpenBCI manufactured headgear and the the proximity was detected through Bluetooth low energy beacons.

Devices and Hardware used:
OpenBCI Ultracortex Mark IV
DragonBoard 410C
Arduino Uno
